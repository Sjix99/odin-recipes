    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <ol style="font-size: medium;"><h4>Step 1: Make the meat sauce</h4>
            <li>Brown your choice of ground meat, such as beef, pork, or a combination of the two, in a large pot or skillet.</li>
            <li>Drain the excess fat from the pan.</li>
            <li>Stir in your tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes, along with your seasonings, such as Italian herbs, garlic, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to combine.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="font-size: medium;"><h4>2: Prepare the cheese mixture</h4>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, grated Parmesan, and herbs like fresh parsley or basil.</li>
            <li>Mix until all the ingredients are well combined.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="font-size: medium;"><h4>Step 3: Cook the noodles</h4>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook the lasagna noodles until they are al dente, meaning they are slightly firm to the bite. If using no-boil noodles, you can skip this step.</li>
            <li>Drain the noodles and lay them flat on a clean towel or parchment paper to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="font-size: medium;"><h4>Step 4: Assemble the lasagna</h4>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350–375°F (175–190°C).</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish to prevent the noodles from sticking.</li>
            <li>Arrange a single layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spread about one-third of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
            <li>Spoon a layer of meat sauce over the cheese.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat these layers until you've used all of your ingredients, typically creating two to three full layers. Finish with a final layer of noodles topped with the remaining meat sauce and plenty of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        </ol>
            <ol style="font-size: medium;"><h4>Step 5: Bake and rest</h4>
            <li>Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil to trap the moisture and ensure the noodles cook through.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30–50 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for another 10–15 minutes, or until the cheese on top is melted and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for at least 15 minutes before serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it much easier to slice.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
